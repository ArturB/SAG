Restaurant Manager
Restaurant Manager - Sumer Restaurant

Syracuse, NY

Over 10 years of progressive experience in national and international program management and implementation so I completely understand the necessity for adhering to rules and protocols and for being reliable and accountable. 
I am accustomed to and successful with working in high pressure and stressful environments where emotions are high and where calm, problem solving, teamwork and patience are critical. 
I am considered by staff, peers, clients and senior leadership to be communicative, a critical thinker with great energy, diplomatic, excellent people skills and enthusiasm, willing to accept challenges head on and to be a part of creating solutions. When required I can work well independently or within a team and I am skilled at prioritizing multiple tasks while still paying attention to details. Nothing gets past me; I am very observant and notice the slightest changes in person's demeanor, behavior and environment.
