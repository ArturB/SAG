I consider myself privileged to have my residency at NYU-LUTHERAN. I am currently a PGY-3 IM resident, 
and I am confident in the guidance I have received with regards to my residency. 
I started my residency during the merger of Lutheran with NYU. So, I can say I was lucky to have had the 
advantages of both legacies. Lutheran is a very busy hospital in Brooklyn, most of our patient population 
are immigrants and non-insured, so I encountered a lot of diverse pathology. 
When Lutheran became a part of NYU, the program started to be more academic. 
Also doing more than 6 months of ICU during my residency made me so confident 
managing very complicated medical conditions.
