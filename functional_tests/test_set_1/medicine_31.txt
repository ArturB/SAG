Internal Medicine Physician Assistant
Comprehensive Adult Medicine -
Wichita, KS

November 2007 to Present

I currently work at an internal medicine private practice with one medical provider and another physician assistant. Asides from seeing , diagnosing and treating patients, I also perform small skin cancer and lesion removals as well. 
Prior to working at my current job,  
I worked in dermatology at Moeller dermatology for two years where I gained in-depth knowledge through seeing and treating numerous skin conditions. 
I graduated in 1999 from Wichita State with my BS in Physicisn Assistant studies. 
My first job was in family practice in Kingman Kansas, where I worked for 5 years before seeking a job close to my home in Wichita. 
With my previous job experiences I have gained not only knowledge, but also experience which can not be taught with any text book. 
I truly believe that a great part of a patients treatment lies in just listening and treating the patient like you would like to be treated. 
Having said that, I am efficient in doing so without compromising time that would be spent seeing another patient and bringing in revenue for the clinic.
