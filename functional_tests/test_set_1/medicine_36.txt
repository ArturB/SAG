Statement 
My love for medicine has grown in the years since my graduation as I've worked through a range of specialities. This has enabled me to integrate my clinical knowledge, image interpretation and clinical skills. I 
have an interest in research as demonstrated in my lab based BSc degree in conjunction with cancer research 
UK. I have always pushed to provide the highest level of patient care and look forward to expanding my 
learning experiences through studying for the national boards and clinical exposure in the US. 
Research Experience 
 
I have completed a laboratory based BSc project in conjunction with Cancer Research UK. I worked on the characterisation of monoclonal antibodies targeting cells expression changes prior to metastasis. This gave 
insights into cell culture, Western Blotting and immunofluorescence as well as experience with effective 
literature review and scientific writing.
