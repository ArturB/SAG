Principal Software Engineer

Sugar Land, TX

• Worked with team to meet user expectations of delivering state of the art software, software enhancements and defect correction in a timely manner 
• Worked with development team to transition from waterfall development to agile, including the culling and creation of user stories and prioritization of 1000+ support cases. 
• Shortened time to market of products by 75% by incorporating the use of continuous integration into the development cycle. Individual tasks were combined into a single script which was initiated by repository updates. Test results were then reported using Junit. VMware vSphere was used virtualize Linux and Windows platforms. 
• Obtained scrum master and product owner training, and 3 years of applied agile experience. 
• Improved processes while reducing the budgetary needs of the development team by researching and implementing the use of open source applications and developing internal solutions. License encryption software was designed and implemented to replace FlexNet software. The in-house license encryption software used product name, product version, start date and expiration date to restrict product use for all IMSL products. In addition Windows Installer software was researched and the open source WiX software was chosen and used to replace InstallShield. 
• Led teams of software packaging analysts in delivering products which met the high quality standards that users expect from IMSL products. Installers were written to install both required and optional product components. For Windows platforms InstallShield/WiX was used and Linux installers were written using sh. The end-user distribution was constructed, installed, QA'd and then provided to users. 
• Extensive experience debugging software/compilers in a timely manner to ensure that product releases were delivered on schedule, including a diverse set of Windows and Linux operating systems. IMSL products make extensive use of programming language features exposing incorrect code generation by compilers. These problems were identified and worked around if a quick fix by the vendor was not possible. This experience has included numerous flavors of Windows and Linux operating systems. 
• Served as both front-end and back-end product support providing users a positive outcome for issues that were encountered. This involved investigating user problems by first duplicating the issue and then providing a resolution. If the problem was a defect in the code or an enhancement request, an issue was created in the team's backlog. 
• Enhanced existing product code to take advantage of hardware advances and to make code more portable and robust. The use of CUDA Toolkit software was integrated for use by IMSL products to take advantage of NVIDIA's GPUs. In addition use of the Xeon Phi processor via Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) was prototyped. Benchmarking was performed for both scenarios. 
• Designed and implemented quality assurance tests and procedures to ensure the integrity of IMSL products. The tests were designed to execute every line of code to expose compiler and logic issues. Each test is run on each supported platform before product release. 
• Enhanced existing software to make it thread-safe ensuring that users could safely run the product using multiple threads. Areas of the code which was not thread-safe were identified and modified. Tests were written to verify that the product was thread-safe. 
• Provided input and assistance to Product Management to ensure that tasks associated with product releases have been addressed. This includes, but is not limited to, populating the FTP site, providing website content and reviewing the resulting website. 
• Configured systems to use MPI for the development, testing and support of IMSL products in both heterogeneous and homogeneous configurations. This experience has provided him the insight into the common problems encountered by users with their system configuration and product use.
