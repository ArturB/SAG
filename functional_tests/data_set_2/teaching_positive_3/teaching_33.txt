I am a current college student attending Rogue Community College with an emphasis on elementary education. I have over 80 units complete and have been applying my knowledge working with the children in my community for the past 6 years. This has helped me gain the power to communicate and build bonds with the students and their families. I have a deep passion for teaching and learning with all that I do. My strongest subject is math and I have excellent communication, critical thinking and organization skills. You will find that I am a hardworking individual who is self motivated and a team player.
