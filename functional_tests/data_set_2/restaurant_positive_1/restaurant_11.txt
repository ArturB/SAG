Was promoted from server to pool restaurant manager at a country club. I led fifteen employees, kept records and ordered inventory, made bank deposits, and calculated labor and par levels. The restaurant and bar were newly renovated, so we created a food and drink menu of our own choosing. I worked with the head chef to pair dishes, wines, and mixed drinks that would sell well, but keep cost of making down. The first two and a half months we were open, we increased sales from the previous year by ten thousand dollars. I organized and set up events at the pool, like birthday parties and political fundraisers.
