Teacher

Indianapolis, IN

My goal is to exceed my experience and education in childcare. My dream is to open my own youth center within the next four years and help be the change I wish to see in the world. Although teaching and caring for children is a passion for me, Iâ€™d like to exceed my education and gain experience in other areas of work, yet still care and provide for those in need.
