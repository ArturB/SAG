C++): Fine-Grained Object-Oriented Artificial Evolution of Artificial Neural Networks 
• Accomplished full lifecycle development of a fine-grained object-oriented system with simulated evolution, neural networks, and fuzzy control libraries using C++ (extensive/intensive debugging experience). 
• Achieved automated, unsupervised design of problem-specific solutions for diverse technical problems, i.e., neural networks for mathematical, classification, pattern recognition, and decision support problems 
• Solved test-of-concept (simple mathematics and logic: XOR2, Complement4, Shift4, Rotate4) and proof-of-concept design problems. Generated novel neural network solutions for Fisher's Classification Problem (Iris Data); NASA O-Ring Performance Prediction; Post-Operative Patient Routing; and the main test - USAF Fighter Pilot Assistance - all with novel and unpredictable design outcomes. 
• Used Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA, SPSS) to evaluate a multifactorial statistical design. Independent variables = Training, Reward, Algorithms, Coefficients, and Self-Adaptation (of coefficients). Dependent variables = Evaluation Cost, Error, Generalization, NProcessors, NConnections, and Fitness (a function of Error, Generalization, NProcessors, and NConnections).. 
• Implemented strong object-oriented design using the Object Modeling Technique, templates (generics), function objects, runtime type information (RTTI), and heavy polymorphism with multiple inheritance. 
• Single-handedly developed fault-free 182,000 C++ LOC to accomplish all of the above (sole author/implementor/etc.). 
• Environment: Sun SPARC Workstation, SunOS (UNIX)/Solaris, gcc, MS Windows (PC) Workstation, Borland C++, MS Visual Studio / MS Visual C++. 
• Technical writing deliverable: Dissertation published at the National Library of Congress.
